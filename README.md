#  Heart Disease Risk Prediction System
The Heart Disease Risk Prediction System is a machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on clinical data (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.).

It uses:
A classification model (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost).
Provides evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score).
Enables making user input-based risk prediction.
Ideal for students and researchers in healthcare AI and data science.

## Features
✅ Data Preprocessing (Handling missing values, scaling, and encoding)
✅ Train a Machine Learning Model (Logistic Regression / Random Forest)
✅ Evaluate Model Accuracy
✅ Make Risk Predictions (Input patient data to get results)

## Technologies Used
Python 3
scikit‑learn (Machine Learning Model, Evaluation Metrics)
pandas (Data Handling)
numpy (Numerical Computation)

## Usage
The program will:
Load the heart disease dataset.
Perform data preprocessing (scaling, splitting).
Train the selected model.
Evaluate the performance.
Prompt the user for patient details (age, BP, cholesterol, etc.).
Output a Risk Prediction.
